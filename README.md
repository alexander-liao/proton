# proton
Proton practical programming language

To run, you will need Python 3. All modules used should come with the standard Python distribution (`operator`, `sys`, `builtins`, `math`, `ast`, and `traceback`).

To run a Proton program, just run `./proton <filename> [args...]`. If you are on Windows or iOS, you may need to change it to `proton.py` and run it with `python proton.py <filename> [args...]`.
